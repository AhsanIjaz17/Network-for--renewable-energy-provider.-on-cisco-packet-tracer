## üîé Project Summary
This project implements a simulated energy-generation/consumption system using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It integrates typical network components (PC, server, switch) with renewable-energy elements (solar panels, wind turbine, battery and power meter) to demonstrate monitoring, control, and energy flow management in a realistic campus-style setup. Key learning goals: network connectivity, telemetry, and control interfaces for energy systems.
